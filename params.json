{"name":"Project Tango Foxtrot","body":"## project_tango_foxtrot\r\n\r\nSOA-ish website platform built on dcell/celluloid in the style of amazon.\r\n\r\n### Inspiration\r\n\r\n- Amazon's [general architecture](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1142065) is awesome.\r\n  - Every component on an amazon page (menu, cart, related items, etc) is its\r\n    own service.\r\n  - Any request to amazon.com fires off ~100 or so requests to various services\r\n    responsible for each part of the page.\r\n  - The page itself has a timeout set, say of 150ms.  When that timeout is hit,\r\n    any of the services that haven't yet returned are just omitted from the\r\n    rendered page.\r\n- [DCell / Celluloid](http://celluloid.io) is fantastic and makes ruby seem\r\n  better.\r\n  - Celluloid is an Akka-like framework to make Plain Old Ruby Objects able to\r\n    run concurrently as Actors.\r\n  - An Actor runs in his own thread.\r\n  - DCell lets you distribute these Celluloid Actors as services all over the\r\n    network, not ust on the same machine.  Distributed Objects generally.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThis project is released under the MIT License.
